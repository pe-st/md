https://klmoney.wordpress.com/beta7-contract-wallets/

- externally owned accounts (controlled by a private key)
- contract account (smart contract, controlled by code) is a wallet

Contract is an autonomous agent, "living" in the Blockchain

### Hot and Cold

From https://www.ethnews.com/how-to-choose-an-ethereum-wallet

- A hot wallet (Jaxx, Coinbase) is an active wallet that is open and accessible. Handlers can easily send funds since it is connected through the virtual world. Hot wallets are used mostly by those who wish to trade or buy Ether more frequently.
- For those who prefer to store Ether, a cold wallet is the best option. Similar to the security a safety deposit box offers, money sent to a paper wallet (MyEtherWallet) or cold hardware (Ledger) stores Ether offline preventing hackers from stealing your funds

## Ethereum Blockchain

- Main Chain
- Testnet (also distributed, less peers, easier to mine to get ether)
- private network, e.g. with https://github.com/matthiaszimmermann/web3j_demo
