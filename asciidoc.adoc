= AsciiDoc

AsciiDoc is a format for writing formatted and organised documentation in plaintext.

This document here is written in AsciiDoc.

There are two toolchains to process AsciiDoc documents:

* AsciiDoc: written in Python
* AsciiDoctor: written in Ruby, thus easily usable from JVM land (e.g. Maven) thanks to JRuby and AsciidoctorJ

[NOTE]
The AsciiDoc website and software seem to be dead (the changelog stops at Version 8.6.9 from 2013-11-09), while there is still some activity on Github

== Notes

=== support

AsciiDoc documents are recognized and rendered on these platforms

* http://asciidoctor.org/news/2013/01/30/asciidoc-returns-to-github/[GitHub] and Gists
* GitLab

Note that Bitbucket needs a plugin for rendering AsciiDoc documents,
and Bitbucket wikis don't support it at all.


=== one colon vs two colons

* `image:<target>[<attributes>]` is an inline macro
* `image::<target>[<attributes>]` is a block macro

See http://asciidoc.org/userguide.html#_block_macros[Block Macros]

Use the block macro to have the image show up in a _list of figures_ etc.
