== docToolchain

* https://github.com/rdmueller/docToolchain[docToolchain] uses asciidoctor to generate arc42 docs

=== setup

* copy the GitHub repo
* remove these folders and files:
** '.git'
** 'docs'
** 'src/docs/manual' and 'src/docs/manual.adoc'
** Everything in 'src/docs/images' except 'arc42-logo.png'
* remove superfluous German stuff when writing in English
** 'scr/docs/\*-de.adoc'

=== using with maven

* the wrapper 'mvnw' is not really needed when you have a working maven installation
** you can remove 'mvnw' and 'mvnw.cmd'
* the 'pom.xml' defines a standard goal, so you can just write `mvn` instead of `mvn generate-resources`
* under the hood https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-maven-plugin[asciidoctor-maven-plugin] is used

=== structure

* document root folder is 'src/docs'
* the name of the root document is configured as `<sourceDocumentName>` in the 'pom.xml',
  if you want to configure it on the command line, you must remove in the 'pom.xml' and then use
  `mvn generate-resources -Dasciidoctor.sourceDocumentName=myroot.adoc`

=== pdf configuration

* The asciidoctor-maven-plugin uses asciidoctorj-pdf to generate PDFs
* https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/blob/master/docs/theming-guide.adoc[asciidoctor pdf theming guide]
